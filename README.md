# RFC 8212 compliance tracking

[RFC 8212](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8212) updates the core BGP
specification ([RFC 4271](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271)) by defining the
default behavior of a BGP speaker when there is no Import or Export Policy
associated with an External BGP session.

# Footnotes

<a name="fn1">1</a>: Arista EOS 4.18.0f allow you to emulate RFC 8212 behaviour by configuring the below, however this is not the default as of yet:
```
bgp missing-policy direction in action deny
bgp missing-policy direction out action deny
```

<a name="fn2">2</a>: Adam Chappell wrote a <a href="https://github.com/packetsource/rfc8212-junos">RFC 8212 SLAX script</a> to side-load a RFC 8212 shim on Junos devices.
